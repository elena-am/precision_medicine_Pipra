# Postoperative Delirium prediction (POD) - PIPRA AG
This project is a part of the [Data Science Bootcamp at Propulsion Academy](https://propulsion.academy/).

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to predict the probabilities of having POD. This cognitive disorders affect up to 40% of senior patients, decreasing the quality of life in different ways and also descreasing the revenues of the hospitals

## Project Description
We got a senstitive data provided by PIPRA AG from almost 3000 patients that had a cardiac surgery. The main goal of the project was to predict the probability of having a POD giving the specialist another source to decide if the should operate a patient or not. Because of that, we had to keep always in mind always the explainability of the models we choose and that was one of the reason we choose a Random Forest Classifier.

Because of the sensitive data some of notebook's prints are removed. Because of that too all the steps of this project related with the data are in just one notebook.

## Needs of this project

- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- explainability

## Notes

- LightGBM need some regular expression methods to be run separately
- Some prints were removed because of the sensitive data
